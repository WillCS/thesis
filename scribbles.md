# For analysing meaningfulness of data
## On the genetic data
- Take a series of backbones at varying p values
- Fit a power law to the degree sequence of each backbone
- Plot the exponents of the power laws against the p values

- Plot backbone size against p value
- Plot backbone strength against p value

## On the random data
- Generate a sample of random data, then for each sample:
  - Take a series of backbones at varying p values
  - Fit a power law to the degree sequence of each backbone
- Take the average exponent of the power laws for each p value
- Plot the average exponents of thepower laws against the p values

- Plot average backbone size against p value
- Plot average backbone strength against p value
